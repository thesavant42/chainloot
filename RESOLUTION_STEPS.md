# Resolution Steps for Microphone Audio Issue

## What Happened

The initial fix added `@cl.on_audio_chunk` to capture microphone audio. However, this decorator **doesn't exist in Chainlit 2.8.1/2.8.2**, causing the app to crash at startup with:

```python
AttributeError: module 'chainlit' has no attribute 'on_audio_chunk'
```

## What Changed

**Commit 0ac5e09**: Reverted app.py and disabled built-in STT
- Removed the `@cl.on_audio_chunk` implementation (app.py back to 458 lines)
- Changed `.chainlit/config.toml`: `speech_to_text.enabled = false`
- App should now start successfully

**Commit 42ac0fd**: Added documentation
- Created `CHAINLIT_VERSION_ISSUE.md` explaining the problem
- Documented 4 possible solution paths

## Testing Instructions

### Step 1: Verify App Starts

```bash
chainlit run app.py
```

**Expected:** App starts without errors
**If fails:** Share the complete error message

### Step 2: Check Chainlit Version

```bash
chainlit --version
```

or

```bash
python -c "import chainlit; print(chainlit.__version__)"
```

### Step 3: Test Microphone (Current State)

With `speech_to_text.enabled = false`:
1. Click microphone icon
2. Speak into mic
3. Stop recording

**Question:** Does `on_message` get triggered with an audio element?

Check console for:
```
AUDIO DIAG: on_message triggered - ... Elements count: 1
AUDIO DIAG: Element 0: type=Audio
```

## Recommended Solution Path

### If You Can Upgrade (Best Option)

```bash
# Upgrade Chainlit to 2.9.0 or later
pip install --upgrade chainlit

# Verify version
chainlit --version
```

Then I can restore the `@cl.on_audio_chunk` implementation which is the cleanest solution.

### If Upgrade Not Possible

We need to find an alternative approach for Chainlit 2.8.x. Options:

1. **Built-in STT Provider**: Configure Chainlit to use your Whisper API
2. **Custom Frontend**: Add JavaScript to handle mic recording
3. **Workaround**: Find another way to capture audio with available hooks

## What I Need From You

Please provide:

1. **Chainlit version**: Output of `chainlit --version`
2. **App startup**: Does it start successfully now?
3. **Mic button**: Does it still appear and can you click it?
4. **Console output**: Any messages when using the mic?
5. **Upgrade possibility**: Can you upgrade Chainlit to 2.9.0+?

## Files Changed

- `app.py`: Reverted to original (458 lines, no `on_audio_chunk`)
- `.chainlit/config.toml`: `speech_to_text.enabled = false`
- `CHAINLIT_VERSION_ISSUE.md`: Problem explanation
- `RESOLUTION_STEPS.md`: This file

## Next Actions

Based on your answers above, I will:
- **If you can upgrade**: Restore the `on_audio_chunk` fix
- **If 2.8.x only**: Research and implement a 2.8.x-compatible solution
- **If something else is wrong**: Debug the actual issue

## Quick Reference

### Original Working State
- File uploads work ✅
- Text input works ✅
- Mic button appears ✅
- But mic audio doesn't trigger transcription ❌

### Current State (After Revert)
- App should start ✅
- File uploads still work ✅
- Text input still works ✅
- Mic behavior: **Unknown - needs testing**

## Important Note

The good news is that we now know why the fix didn't work. The `@cl.on_audio_chunk` approach is correct for modern Chainlit versions - we just need to either upgrade Chainlit or find an alternative approach for version 2.8.x.
